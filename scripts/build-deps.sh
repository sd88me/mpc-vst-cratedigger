# Fetch the runtime dependencies force-cratedigger needs beyond its own
# compiled binary: yt-dlp and ffmpeg/ffprobe. Adapted from upstream
# schwung-webstream's scripts/build-deps.sh for the Force's actual
# architecture (armv7l/armhf — 32-bit, unlike Move's aarch64), which
# changes where ffmpeg comes from and drops deno entirely:
#
#   - yt-dlp: unchanged from upstream. Fetched as upstream's own published
#     release zipapp (see the comment at that step for why, and for the
#     real-world bug this caught), which is architecture-independent — it
#     runs under any Python 3.8+, arm or not.
#   - ffmpeg/ffprobe: upstream's source (yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds) only
#     publishes linux64/linuxarm64, no 32-bit ARM. johnvansickle.com's
#     well-known static builds do publish an armhf variant — used here
#     instead.
#   - deno: DROPPED. Deno has no official armv7/armhf Linux build (only
#     x86_64 and aarch64). yt-dlp's own JS interpreter is used as the
#     fallback for YouTube signature-cipher extraction instead — this
#     works for most videos but is a known-weaker fallback than deno for
#     the small subset of newer/more obfuscated signature challenges (see
#     README.md's Known Limitations section). soundcloud/archive/
#     freesound/cratedig do not use deno at all.

echo "=== Fetching yt-dlp (official release zipapp, latest) ==="
# Was previously built from source (`git clone` + `make lazy-extractors
# yt-dlp`) - switched to fetching upstream's own published release asset
# instead, for two reasons found live on 2026-09-23: (1) that build needs
# a `zip` binary on the build host, which isn't always installed (this
# host didn't have one, blocking a rebuild); (2) a stale bundled yt-dlp is
# a real, silent failure mode, not a theoretical one - a build from months
# ago (2024.10.22) was still deployed on a live device and caused every
# YouTube-backed search result to fail with "The page needs to be
# reloaded" (a signature-cipher extraction error, not the already-known
# no-`deno` limitation this looked like at first).
#
# UPDATE 2026-09-23: back to "latest", not pinned. The pin above existed
# because yt-dlp 2024.12.13 dropped Python 3.8 support entirely (hard
# `sys.version_info` check, raises ImportError) and this addon's yt-dlp
# used to run under the device's SYSTEM Python (3.8.10). That's no longer
# true: scripts/build-python.sh bundles a private Python 3.11 specifically
# so this addon can track yt-dlp's actual latest release (needed to keep
# up with YouTube's evolving anti-bot JS challenge - see that script's
# header) instead of being frozen in time. Run build-python.sh alongside
# this script; without it, the fetched yt-dlp here will fail to even start
# under the device's own system Python 3.8, same failure mode as before.
